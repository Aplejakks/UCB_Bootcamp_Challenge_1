# Loan Analyzer
Financial Programming with Python

This simple project was ana exercise in using Python in a financial context.
## Part 1

Part 1 of this code uses 5 sample loan amounts to practice parsing variables to gather extra data, including the amount, sum, and average of the loans in question.

## Part 2

Part 2 of this code uses the Present Value Formula to analyze a loan and determine if its is good value.
If the fair value of the loan is greater than or equal to the price of the loan, it is deemed to be a good loan.
